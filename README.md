Weather App

Welcome to My Weather App!

I built this weather app to help you quickly check the current weather conditions for any city. It's a simple but useful tool that uses real-time data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

What Can It Do?

- Search for weather data by city name
- Fetch real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API
- Update the UI dynamically with the latest data
- Show you the current temperature, weather description, and more
- Provide additional weather details such as cloud cover, humidity, and pressure
- Display weather data in a clean and easy-to-read format
- Allow users to search for weather data by city name

How Was It Built?

I used the following technologies to build this app:

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3
- OpenWeatherMap API

Why These Technologies?

I chose these technologies because they are well-suited for building a simple web application like this weather app.

- JavaScript is a versatile language that allows for dynamic client-side functionality.
- HTML5 provides a robust structure for building web applications.
- CSS3 enables styling and layout of the application.
- The OpenWeatherMap API provides real-time weather data that is easy to integrate into the application.

How to Use It

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. Type the name of a city in the search bar and press Enter.
